I'm a JavaScript full stack web developer with 7-year+ work experience developing mobile and web applications. From Gal√°pagos, the land of the giant tortoises üê¢ to Guayaquil, I currently work at [Jobsity](https://www.jobsity.com/)/[Parallel Public Works](https://www.parallelpublicworks.com/). I love to create exceptional technology stuff showing what I got for this world.
