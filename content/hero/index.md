I'm a JavaScript full stack web developer with 5-year work experience developing mobile and web applications. From Gal√°pagos, the land of the giant tortoises üê¢ to Guayaquil, I currently work at [Ecudevs](https://www.ecudevs.com/). I love to create exceptional technology stuff showing what I got for this world.
