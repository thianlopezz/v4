- Developed a microsite using Laravel and Tailwind CSS that had to support +50k clients, allowing users to check if applicable to get digital coupons.
- Built a WordPress plugin with PHP logic to synchronize WooCommerce entities (products, orders, categories, tags, etc) capable of being reused to integrate whichever client wants to implement an eCommerce website. This plugin is working on 3 client shops ([Juan Marcet](https://juanmarcet.com/), [Disensa](https://disensa.com.ec/), [Veris](https://www.veris.com.ec/)).
- Programmed a self-checkout [solution](https://go.hispanadeseguros.com/) for an assurance company, automating the sale of insurance policies using Ionic Framework and the WooCommerce API. Its automation released the operational work for the car revision process.
